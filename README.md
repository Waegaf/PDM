# Infimal Convolution of Total Variation and Convex Neural Network Regularizer
This is the code related to [thesis](https://github.com/Waegaf/PDM/blob/master/Paper.pdf).

The main constructions of the neural networks are from the following githubs of the Biomedical Imaging Group (EPFL):
- [convex ridge regularizer neural network](https://github.com/axgoujon/convex_ridge_regularizers)
- [weakly convex ridge regularizer neural network](https://github.com/axgoujon/weakly_convex_ridge_regularizer)


## Python environment details
Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of the packages used:
- python (3.10)
- matplotlib
- opencv-python
- pylops-gpu
- tensorboard
- tqdm
- numpy
- scipy

## Structure of the code
All the specific code to the thesis can be found under the Infimal_conv directory.
